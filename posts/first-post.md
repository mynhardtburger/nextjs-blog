This has been a surprisingly smooth experience putting together my first project using Next.js. The deployment of a simple website like this using Vercel has also been great with:

* GitHub integration
* Branch preview
* Automatic deployment on merging with the production branch
* Automated SSL setup

How next.js scales with project size I'm not sure about, but for now the developer experience has been great!.

PS. this entry is was created by adding a markdown file to the right folder with some basic YAML frontmatter. How cool is that?
